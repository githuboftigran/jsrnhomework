App should ask user to input a number or "exit" in a popup window.
After user enters a natural (positive integer) number (n), app should log n-th prime number in console.
Example:
prompt: Enter a natural number or "exit"
6
log: 6th prime number is 13

After logging the result in console, app should ask for a number or "exit" again and the flow should be repeated.
If user types "exit" instead of a natural number, app execution should be ended.

let, const and functions are not allowed.

////////////////////////////////////////////

Use

    var num = prompt('Enter a natural number or "exit"');

to get input value in num variable.
If you are familiar with C++, this is like:

    int num;
    cin>>num;

Use console.log to log a value of a statement in console:

    console.log('some text');
    console.log(aVariable);
    console.log('some text' + aVariable);

And this is like:
    cout<<variableName;

May the Force be with you!
