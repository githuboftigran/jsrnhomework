You can find a brand new react native project under src/JSReactApp directory.
Before start, please read this page paying attention to lifecycle methods:
https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html

This is a JS library for http calls:
https://github.com/axios/axios

And this is a dummy REST API you can use to get, post data:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

You will need posts, comments, users and photos resources.
App should have a header part with 2 buttons: Back and Refresh.
All the other stuff should be rendered below that header section.

|   Back  |   Refresh   |
-------------------------
|                       |
|                       |
|                       |
|                       |
|                       |
|                       |
|                       |
|                       |

When user opens the app a get request should be made to fetch all posts:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

Once all posts are loaded, they should be shown in a list (FlatList).
Each post has a title and a body, so each list item should have 2 texts.
The title should have bigger font size and bold style.
To help user, posts with even index should have white background (#fff) and posts with odd index should have light grey background (#eee).

When user clicks on a post item, posts should disappear and comments of that particular post should be fetched:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/3/comments
See that number "3" just before /comments part? That's the post id.
So making a GET request with the path above will give you comments array of post with id: 3 in response.
Each comment has name, email and body.
So a comment item should look like this:

|Elon Musk              emusk@tesla.com |
|                                       |
|Some long speech about Mars, cars,     |
|electricity, etc.                      |

-----------------------------
Back button

Back button should be enabled (clickable and alive-looking) only when comments screen is shown.
Click should take user back to posts screen.
When posts screen is shown, back button should be disable (not clickable and greyish, so user understands it's not clickable).

-----------------------------
Refresh button

When user clicks refresh button the screen should be refreshed, which means a new GET request should be made and a fresh data should be fetched from api.
If user is in posts screen, refresh should fetch posts and update the list.
If user is in comments screen, refresh should fetch comments and update the list.

------------------------------
While fetching data
When a data is being fetched from the api, an ActivityIndicator should be shown just below the header part:
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/activityindicator
No matter if the list already has some items (for example refresh button is clicked) or it's empty.
ActivityIndicator should be shown ON TOP OF, not ABOVE the list.

Try to write clean code and not to put everything together in 1 file.

May the Force be with you!
