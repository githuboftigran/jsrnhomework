In this directory you can find an html file: game.html.
If you open it in browser you will see a space with many color balls.
Click once at any point and a chain reaction will begin.
When a ball touches exploding area it stops and explodes giving some points depending on the previous area's points it touched.

First explosion (user's click) gives 10 points. All balls touching that area will explode and give 10 * 1.6 = 16 points.
All balls touching second chain of explosion will give 16 * 1.6 = 25.6 (~26) points, etc.
So if a ball touches exploding area with X points, it gives Math.round(X * 1.6) points.
Explosion lasts 3 seconds and exploded area fades out during that time.
Exploding process (ball resizing) should last 500 milliseconds.
Game ends, when all exploded areas are gone.
Reset button should reset the score and start a new game.

Velocities of balls should be equal but initial positions and velocity directions should be random.

Please don't copy code from this game.html file, as it's written in 2012 and in a really bad way.
This file is just for demonstration, not for copying.

You can find a few lines of code in assignment3.js file.

At line 8, an arrow function is passed to addEventListener.
That function will be called every time user clicks canvas.
Parameter `event` contains click's coordinates (offsetX, offsetY).

At line 13 an arrow function is set to resetButton's onclick.
This function will be called every time user clicks reset button.

May the Force be with you!
