At this time you don't need to create a new js file, just update asignment1.js.
Create functions for each shape type (Rect, Circle, Triangle) and these functions should be responsible for descriptor deserializing.
Create another function parseShape(descriptor).
It should take the descriptor, determine the shape, call appropriate shape function with new operator and return the result.

Note: shapes have lot of common stuff so make sure there are no code copies.
Refactored assignment 1 code is in branch: assignment1 (not completed).

Here you can find our drafts:

May the Force be with you!
